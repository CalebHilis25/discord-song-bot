AMAZING GRACE
by Traditional

**[Verse 1]**
**G       C       G**
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
**G       D       G**
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

**[Chorus]**
**G       C       G**
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
**D       G**
That saved a wretch like me
