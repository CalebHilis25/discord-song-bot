THAT SAVED A WRETCH LIKE ME
by Unknown Artist

**[VERSE 1]**
**G C G**
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
**G D G**
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

**[CHORUS]**
**G C G**
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
**D G**
That saved a wretch like me

**[VERSE 2]**
**G C G**
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
**G D G**
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
