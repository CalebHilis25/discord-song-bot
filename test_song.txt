Amazing Grace

[Verse 1]
G       C       G
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
G       D       G
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

[Verse 2] 
G       C       G
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
G       D       G
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

[Chorus]
G       C       G
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
D       G
That saved a wretch like me

[Bridge]
C       G       D       G
When we've been there ten thousand years
C       G       D       G
Bright shining as the sun
